Fundamental of Computing 1 Final Project

This is the final project for my Fundamentals of Computing 1 course I took as a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame. My partner, Eric Krebs, and I created a 2-D video game entitled "Rocket Rover". The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible by accelerating through an obstacle course. The ship is controlled by the arrow keys and accelerated by the spacebar.
